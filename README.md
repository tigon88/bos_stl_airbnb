## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, i was interested in using AirBnB data for Boston and Seattle to better understand the short term rental market, specifically:
1) Seasonality effect on pricing
2) Pricing difference between weeekdays and weekends
3) Property type that fecthes higher listing price
4) The location factor on pricing
5) Other factors that influence listing price
6) Additional insights from user comments
7) Most common amenities furnished in airbnb listings
